# tmux configuration

Designed to live in `~/.tmux.conf.d`, with a symlink of:

```
~/.tmux.conf -> ~/.tmux.conf.d/tmux.conf
```

A little messy, I know, but at least this way I can keep it all in a nice
tidy repository.

I really do wish more tools would embrace keeping config in a directory in
`~/.config`, or at least having a documented environment variable I can set
to point to the config file. Seems `tmux` has support for none of that. :-(
